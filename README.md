Use Case 9 – Recursive Palindrome Checker

Objective
To check whether a string is a palindrome using recursion by comparing characters from the start and end positions.

Flow
1. Accept input from user.
2. Call a recursive function with start and end indexes.
3. Compare start and end characters.
4. If characters match, make recursive call for inner substring.
5. Use base condition to stop recursion.
6. Display result.
